The atom editor is great for pretty much any text editing work that you want to do. It has a huge range of options and great documentation, but just wanted to share a few of my favourite features that make development easier.

## Most useful commands in atom
1. Command Palette `cmd+shift+P`
  Almost everything can be done from here. I rarely bother with learning key mappings.
2. Toggle tree view `cmd+\`
  Give yourself a bit more space.
3. Go to line (and column) `ctrl+g`
4. Show symbol list `cmd+r`
  Just things like function names.


## Jekyll for blogs
If you use [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for your blog as this one does then the [Jekyll-Atom](https://atom.io/packages/jekyll) plugin is worth installing. Rather than reading through docs just use ```cmd+shift+P``` and type jekyll to filter your options.
